Notey is a simple note storage program written in Java and JavaFX. It currently supports local notes, which can contain:
* regular text
* images
* headings

It does this by converting what the user enteres to HTML, and using a JavaFX WebView to display it.

To do:
* Clean up the code
* Add support for audio
* Download remote media (images, audio, etc) locally to prevent the need to redownload everytime notey starts
* Some form of sync service
* A mobile app?
